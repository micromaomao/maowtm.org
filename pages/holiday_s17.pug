    h2 Things to get done
    p
      | I will try to divide all big tasks into small, achievable sub-tasks, so that
      | infinite procrastination is less likely to happen.
    h3 Top priority
    ul
      li
        h4 Study AS subjects in advance.
        h5 Why?
        p
          | Iâ€™m a bit interested in sociology, and pre-learning some AS physics and math is
          | also going to be useful since these subjects requiring much mental work on
          | understanding.
      li
        h4 Decide which country am I going for university and do relevant preparation.
        h5 Why?
        p
          | As many students, teachers and parents often said, preparation should start as
          | early as possible. I haven't (even) fully decided the overall direction yet, so
          | I should act fast.
      li
        h4 Complete my first neural network.
        h5 Why?
        p
          | For long time I always wanted to learn and make use of machine learning. I had
          | already made a bit of progress on that. Inspired by the Google I/O 2017, I
          | think machine learning is likely going to be a very useful skill in the future.
          | In addition to helping me do more with code, having some skills in machine
          | learning could also help me find a job.
      li
        h4 Build a basic collection system for SchSrch.
        h5 Why?
        p
          | Many of SchSrch's user had asked for this feature for months.
      li
        h4 Finish at least one more book.
        h5 Why?
        p
          | Many people I know seems to have read a lot of books, and I frequently hear
          | people saying that reading books is better than reading ZhiHu or other online
          | stuff.
    h3 Optional
    p
      | I may or may not complete these, depending on my time availability.
    ul
      li
        h4 Write unit tests for older projects.
        h5 Why?
        p
          | Tests are good ways to ensure code quality. I may even consider completely
          | refactoring some of those, so that ugly code won't put me in shame, especially
          | if I'm going to use them to apply for university.
      li
        h4 Start a YouTube channel.
        h5 Why?
        p
          | It may not earn me much money but I could gain some popularity, which is great
          | for university application and self-esteem.
      li
        h4 Practice sketching.
        h5 Why?
        p
          | Doesn't it feel wonderful if a coder also know how to draw beautiful pictures /
          | comics in addition to writing great code? I have always wanted (and tried for
          | several times) to learn drawing. It helps me illustrate my ideas.
