      a(href='https://github.com/micromaomao') side projects
      | . Only&nbsp;
      a(href='https://github.com/micromaomao/schsrch') one of the projects
      |  have a significant user base and is constantly maintained by Mao.
      | Mao especially enjoys coding in Rust and Python, and knows some C, Go
      | and JavaScript. Mao believes that new things can be learned quickly,
      | and is constantly learning new languages (currently C++, Haskell,
      | Wolfram). Mao does reasonably well academically so far. Mao sometime
      | has trouble dealing with emotions and social relationships, and might
      | be suffering from depression for a lot of reasons.
