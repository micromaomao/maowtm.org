    h2 Currently Learning <small>( practising )</small>
    p.desc What I can't do without it and what I can do with it.
    h3 Application of Algorithm
    p
      | Maybe this is a very important skill for programming. Without it I can't solve interview
      | problems! By saying "Application", I mean the ability to solve complex (interview) problems
      | by making use of well-known algorithm and data structures (in a unique way).
    h3 Drawing
    p
      | Just for fun. Sometimes I draw stick figure comics, sometimes not-very-stick-figure-like stick
      | figure comic, and sometimes stick figure animation. Fun aside, it turns out to be a very useful
      | skill sometimes. However, my drawing skill, for non stick-figure, is awful, still practising.
    h3 Functional Programming
    p
      a(href="https://www.haskell.org/") Haskell
      | . Hoping that it will speed up my coding process. By far it is slowing down.
    p
      | You can check out 
      a(href="https://github.com/micromaomao/aabb-game/blob/master/aabb.hs") my first Haskell program
      | . Please give feedback if you know Haskell.
    h3 English
    p
      | Not only do I need to use this to communicate, I also need to use this to pass standardized test.
    h3
      code \#{school.getCurrentSubjects()}
    p
      | So I can pass standardized test!
    p
      | I'm not doing very well in school. I have two language subject: one is called Chinese, and
      | one is called English. I'm a native Chinese speaker, but my Chinese test score
      | is a little disappointing. ( and my English skill is also disappointing which means
      | I have no "mastered" language. )
    p
      | I have Math, Physics which I'm both doing well, but I also have 
      span.emp.shake chemistry
      |  which is another nightmare.
    p
      | Business is pretty <i>easy</i> ( compared to other subjects ). History is yet another nightmare.
