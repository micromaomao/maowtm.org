  h2 Projects
  p
    i Actually... I don't have many useful projects!ðŸ˜‚
  p
    | I have a tons of little projects that I stooped maintaining as soon as development was finished. Those projects
    | are not worth mentioning here again. You can check these out on my 
    a(href='https://github.com/micromaomao?tab=repositories') GitHub profile
    | .
  p
    | Here are some significant stuff worth mentioning on my personal page (this page) that would demonstrate my skills on programming. 
  h3 Web Projects
  ul
    +project('SchSrch', ['Web', 'Javascript', 'Progressive Web Apps', 'node.js'],
      'https://schsrch.xyz/', ['In-progress', 'Lack testing'], {logo: mapStatic('/imgs/schsrch.png')})
      p
        | This is my first <b>Progressive Web App</b>. By building this I learned about the common practises on building a Web App. I have made
        | it truly "Progressive" by making it in a way that is useable even when Javascript is disabled. It contains a <b>ServiceWorker</b> generated
        | via a Webpack plugin. I learned how <b>Webpack</b> works while building this project, and I also learned about keeping the running state of
        | an App by using <b>Redux</b>. I also learned some <b>optimization</b> technique for building a (near) 60fps UI. Give it a try - it should behave like an usual APP.
      p
        | This is a website that enables anyone to do full text search in all of CIE past papers. It has helped many of my classmates for
        | efficient revision. It also offers an robust syntax for searching a particular (set of) paper, which allows users to quickly found
        | the paper they want, without scrolling through a long list of all PDF files (which is what other past paper websites force user to do).
    +project("maowtm.org", ["Web", "node.js", "Javascript"],
      "https://github.com/micromaomao/maowtm.org", ["In-progress"], {logo: mapStatic('/svg/logo.svg')})
      p
        | This is my personal website running on my little server. It is built with <b>Nodejs</b> and I like Nodejs. I learned about building websites
        | with Nodejs and some Web best practises. I also learned <b>Sass</b> by using it in this project. I also follow a standard <b>coding style</b> in this project
        | for all Javascript.
      p
        | This website don't contain much useful stuff, just my personal things.
    +project("Brainfuck-tape", ["Javascript", "Web"], "https://github.com/micromaomao/brainfuck-tape")
      | This is an early project I built. The code may be childish and may look silly to experienced programmers.
      | It is a simple <b>BrainFuck</b> interpreter, with running code highlight, infinite* bidirectional tape,
      | tape monitoring...
  h3 Desktop Apps
  ul
    +project("Shanbay Desktop", ["Electron", "Web", "React", "Javascript", "node.js"],
      "https://github.com/micromaomao/Better-Shanbay", ["Lack testing"], true)
      p
        | This is my first non-trival desktop App. It is built with Web stuff, and was packaged with <b>Electron</b>, which makes use of Chromium.
        | I started to try <b>React</b> while building this, and I also used <b>Webpack</b> for the first time while building this project. There is
        | one big problem - Electron Apps is very large in size of final package because of the Webkit included in the App, so it may be less practical.
      p
        | This App is a 
        a(href="https://shanbay.com") Shanbay
        |  desktop client, which was aimed to help you recite vocabulary. I don't recommend doing that except for emergency test purpose.
  h3 Command Line Utils
  ul
    +project("Ecbpass", ["Python"], "https://github.com/micromaomao/ecbpass")
      | I learned <b>Python</b> while building this. It is a simple tool that allows you to generate pseudorandom password for each site and no need
      | to store it or remember it.
    +project("Pomodoro-Timer", ["C++", "Linux"], "https://github.com/micromaomao/Pomodoro-Timer")
      | I learned about building stuff for <b>Linux</b> with <b>C++</b> with this project.
      | It is a not-simple-to-use, command line Pomodoro timer.
