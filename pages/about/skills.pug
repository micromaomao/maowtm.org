            | I begin to write code about #{Math.round(age-8.5 * 10) / 10} years ago.
            | From dumb to <i><del>smart </del>not dumb</i>, I have experienced with
            | <i>some</i> major programming <i>( standards )</i>. I know how to organize
            | my code properly. I also understand the concept of
            | unit testing ( and code coverage ) and 
            a(href="https://travis-ci.org/micromaomao/maowtm.org") had done it
            |  for <i>some</i> of my projects, and will try to write test for
            | every project of mime.

            | However, I'm (currently) <b>weak</b> on algorithm, data structures or
            | <i>"problem solving skills"</i> and can't solve most of the <i>interview
            | questions that every programmer is supposed to be able to solve</i>
            | . (I mean, can't solve it efficiently.)
            | I'm currently learning about algorithms.
        p
            | Also <b>I'm having problem</b> with writing human-readable and comprehensible
            | code. Sometimes my code don't even make sense to me <i>quickly</i>. Also I didn't tried

                    a(href="https://expressjs.com/") Express.js
                    |  framework. I also use template engine like

                    |  (aka. Jade) to help generating html and

                    |  and I've managed to build a useful desktop app with 
                    a(href="http://electron.atom.io/") Electron
                    | . I know there's some downside with doing these things, like the resulting app package will be
                    | pretty big ( over 40 MB after compressed ). Didn't tried Qt though, maybe that will be better.
