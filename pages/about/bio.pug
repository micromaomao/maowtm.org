    | <b>I'm a programmer</b>. I write code throughout my childhood. Sometimes I
    | consider myself an "<i>expert</i>" on programming, but often I end up finding
    | out that I'm way far from an "<i>expert</i>". <b>I love open source and free culture</b>
    | and share <b>almost</b> everything I created. I've written a lot of code while for most of
    | them, I end up taking them down from GitHub 1 or 2 years later, usually because I think
    | those code were poorly written. I still keep them as archive on a disk
    | placed in my drawer.  <i>And it turns out that disk had gone.</i>

    | <b>I'm "emotionally" strange</b>. I often feel shamed by my old Facebook ( or WeChat )
    | posts because I used to overthink too much and sometimes took things too seriously.
    | I often overthink and therefore feel bad with no logical reason when I faced rejection and
    | it's kind of hard for me to deny others request.

    | <b>I'm technically strange.</b> I like to make use of <i>technologies</i> like fancy cryptography
    | and end up getting things overcomplicated. ( I still think we should all go https though. )
    | Also I often brings unnecessary <i>logic</i> to life and end up doing weird things.
    | I often try to summarize things happen in real life into determined rules or theories.
